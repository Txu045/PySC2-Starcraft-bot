# PySC2-Starcraft-bot
## Starcraft AI scripts

Introductory and learning scripts for simple Starcraft 2 agents. 

For learning basic functions in deepmind's [PySC2 - StarCraft II Learning Environment](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) 

Agents currently gather resources to rush the enemy with constant waves of basic units.
